*******System Architecture**************:
--Frontend:
Built using React for the user interface.
Utilizes components for the SQL editor, query results display, and database connection settings.
Allows users to write SQL queries, execute them, and view results.
Provides options to switch between BigQuery and Snowflake connections.

--Backend:
Developed using Node.js to handle database interactions.
Acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the respective database APIs.
Manages authentication and authorization for both BigQuery and Snowflake.
Executes SQL queries on behalf of the frontend and returns results.

--Database Connections:
Implements connections to Google BigQuery and Snowflake using their respective APIs.
Handles connection pooling and resource management efficiently.
Ensures secure communication between the application and the databases.


*****-----Key Features----********:
--Switch Between Databases:
Users can easily toggle between BigQuery and Snowflake connections within the editor.
The system maintains separate connections for each database type.

--SQL Editor:
Provides a text editor with syntax highlighting and autocomplete features for SQL queries.
Supports common SQL operations such as querying, updating, and deleting data.
Includes error highlighting and suggestions for query optimization.

--Query Execution:
Allows users to execute SQL queries with a single click.
Displays execution progress and results in real-time.
Supports asynchronous execution for long-running queries.

--Result Display:
Presents query results in a tabular format similar to Snowflake's interface.
Supports pagination and filtering of large result sets.
Includes options for exporting results to CSV or other formats.

--Connection Management:
Enables users to manage database connections, including adding, editing, and deleting connections.
Stores connection settings securely and allows for easy switching between saved connections.

*******----Future Scalability----*******:
--Performance Optimization:
Implement query caching and result caching to improve performance.
Optimize database connections and resource utilization for scalability.

--Horizontal Scaling:
Deploy the application on scalable infrastructure such as Kubernetes or AWS ECS.
Utilize load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances.

--Integration with Additional Databases:
Extend support for other databases beyond BigQuery and Snowflake.
Design the system with modularity to easily integrate new database connectors.

--Monitoring and Logging:
Implement monitoring tools to track system performance and identify bottlenecks.
Integrate logging mechanisms to capture errors and user activities for troubleshooting.
